Tutorial 1: Introduction
----------
React native is build on top on javascript.
It is used to build android, ios and web apps
React native will convert UI code to web, android or ios
Mostly the UI related will be written in UI native component and logic will be written in javascript


Tutorial 2: Setup and Creating first app with expo
---------------

Go to https://reactnative.dev/
Click getting started
Click on environment setup -> Setting up the development environment
It gives two option to install 1. Expo cli 2. React native cli

Expo cli vs react native cli

Expo cli:
1. Its is free third party's one
2. Easy to setup and run
3. Native feature wont be available.
4. Mostly for starting android and ios
5. Less control. We wont have more control on it

React native cli:
1. Its native cli
2. Complex to setup and run
3. Its a native feature
4. Can write own code to start for android and ios
5. Has more control. We have all the control of this


Go to https://expo.dev/
We can check the sample code and its look in main page.
we can select web or android or ios or my device to show the preview
To run in our own device, we need to install expo from play store or app store.
Scan the QR code which is shown in expo portal


Installation:
Install recent node js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Give below command to check whether node js is installed or not
node -v
npm -v

We can use any IDE. Mostly the visual studio code would be better.

To install expo, use any one of the below command:
npm install -g expo-cli
or
yarn global add expo-cli


To create first project using expo use below command:
expo init projectname
Eg:
expo init myfirstapp

//we can select blank if we want to create with blank project. 
Project will be created.
Project will be created by default with yarn.
yarn start - will used to open the expo page. There we can choose what is required
yarn android - It will run on android
yarn ios - It will run on ios
yarn web - It will run on web


Use below command to go inside the created project:
cd projectname
Eg:
cd myfirstapp

Use below command to run the project:
yarn start

//This will show the QR code and also opens the expo in browser.
There also we can see the QR code. We can select the QR code in expo app to run on the device.
The web portal also shows, which portal we wanted to run. android or ios or web etc. we can select that


To change content:
Go to App.js file
Change the content and see whether it is reflecting or not



Tutorial 3: Create native app with react cli and ejecting expo project
-----------------------
react naticel cli project will have more feature and control when compare to expo project

Go to https://reactnative.dev/
Click Get started
Click environment setup
Select React native quick start
Select development os (PC OS)
Select Target os (mobile os)       //ios will be supported only in mac os


Follow the instruction given in documentation
Install node js, java and setup the environment variable for java
Node version should be 10 or higher
jdk version should be 8 or higher


Install android studio and setup the environment variable for android sdk
Install latest version of android studio. 
Open android studio, go to sdk manager
Select show package details   //Here we can see the android version
Go to sdk tool tab, we can see the installed sdk tool version. Make sure package and sdk tool version are installed for same version
Add ANDROID_HOME environment variable for sdk path
Add ANDROID_PTOOLS enviroment variable for platform tools path

//if we previously installed react-native-cli package, then we need to remove that as it might cause some unexpected issue


Go to folder where we wanted to create new project
Use below command to create new project
npx react-native init Projectname
npx react-native init MyFirstProject
//This will create the project with default dependencies
Go inside the project using cd command
cd MyFirstProject

We can use physical device or emulator device


Make sure virtualization is enabled in system.

Open android studio, Open AVD manager
Here we can see list of emulator, if not there we can create new one by giving required details.
After adding the emulator, we can launch the emulator
Wait for emulator to fully up
If we face any problem in AVD manager, then go to SDK manager and check whether emulator accelator is installed or not


Use below command to build the project
npx react-native start


Open one more terminal and 
Use below command to install and run the apk 
npx react-native run-android
//This will run the app in emulator/device
//we can see the app will lauching a
//now we can edit the content to check whether edited content is reflecting or not

Thats it



Converting expo project to react native project:

Go to the root of the project.
Eg:
cd MyFirstProject

Run below command to eject from expo and show react native project
Eg:
npm run eject  
//it will asks few details, give required details
//if we eject in mac system, we will have android and ios package. 
// if we eject in windows or linux system, then we will have only android package

Give below command to run in device/emulator
npx react-native run-android
//This will run the app in device/emulator

Thats it














Notes:
------
------

expo build:android     //This is to create apk and save to expo site

adb install file.apk    //This is to install apk in connected device using adb command


npm run eject  //This will create folder seperately for android/ios 


react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
//This command is to build the bundle

cd android


./gradlew assembleDebug
